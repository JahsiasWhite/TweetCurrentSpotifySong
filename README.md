<h1> Tweet Current Spotify Song </h1>
Uses the Spotify, Genius, and Twitter API to find the song you are currently listening to and Tweets out the song name, description about the song, and the cover art.
Uses python to get spotify and genius data. The java script file then uses this info to post a tweet. <br>
I used both python and JS to help me learn those languages.

<h2> Setup </h2>
Requires pip install spotipy <br>
Requires npm install twit
